                Day 2 in the hospital with Kai - Dad brought AJ along and he got to meet his brother for the first time. He was lovely and gentle with him - although a little jealous and affectionate towards Julie.<br/>
<br/>
Drove AJ to Mum's in the evening with Tim - helped him feed and bath AJ, before I left to head home.

Stayed at the hospital with Julie &amp; Kai until 8:30pm'ish - then went home, did a bit of tidying up, then crashed out early for the interview tomorrow.

                Went to the gym - during squats I pulled a wick off my little finger, and it bled profusely to the point where I had to stop lifting and just do a run to avoid getting blood on things.<br/>

Spent the day rebuilding the server to make space for a GPU - had issues with the umart 5.25 to 3.5 drive bays as my Seagate 8tb drive was missing the middle mounting holes required.

                Drove AJ to supercheap at Chermside to pickup the JVC Android Auto head unit I bought for the 86 - started installing it and decided to get a harness to make it simpler, so drove back to Repco at Kedron to get one.<br/>
<br/>It didn't fit - so I had to solder the wires. Flattened the battery in the process.

                Bought a battery from Supercheap for the 86 with AJ - picked up Gia coffee with him on the way home.<br/><br/>Made curry for dinner, Ba Ngoi had some with us - but AJ refused and went to bed without dinner.

                First day back to work - got brought into the Executive Strategy day which was interesting, but took a lot of my time and I fell further behind in my catch-up work.<br/>
<br/>Went running after work - and Dennis called me. We talked about him being in Lisbon now, and his experiences in India, and how Nepal is his favourite place.

Quickly ate dinner (pork broken rice) sitting in our bed in air con trying to get AJ to rest, while Julie had a shower.

                First day dropped AJ off at daycare before work - he behaved himself, although I was a little late.<br/><br/>Ran very late in the night - only intended to do a 5k but ran past the turn. Did a fast 5k, then a slower 7k loop back - before standing in the bedroom with the air-con while Julie breastfed Kai so I could cool down.

                Finally signed my work contract - agreed to it as-is. Went for a drive with Jack from work in his RS3, slower than I expected - certainly not Evo fast (not even 98 octane Evo fast)<br/>

Got take away from the Chinese place between Carroway Pier and the Japanese Sushi train at Kelvin Grove. Parked underneath Woolworths, where a guy had the card machine apart doing some maintenance on it.

                Went for an earlier run down to coronation drive - there were people all along the running track. I bailed off the track, and ran back along the footpath next to the road to avoid them all.

                Up super early to meet the PF guys at Keperra Bunnings for a mountain run. Didn't really know anyone there - but chatted to a few people. One of the drivers was from 'The Nugget Garage' YouTube show in his AE86.<br/>

It started raining, so we stood under the awning of the Bunnings loading dock.<br/>

After driving over Mt Glorious, I peeled off to pee and turned back to follow an Alfa Romeo 4C back over the mountain.<br/>

For dinner I made the first candlelit dinner since Kai came along - make butter searched sirloin steaks, duck fat potatoes (first time I'd used duck fat), roast pumpkin, and garlic and butter beans.

                Went to the Brickhouse and saw Mark and Adam for the first time in forever. Mark told us about his iowaska experiences with the shaman in Peru, and AJ proceeded to pee himself on the seat.

                Slept in and skipped the Lakeside Happy Laps I paid for with the 86 club. We walked the boys down to the Kelvin Grove market and met up with Jassie. AJ played on the ramps/stairs opposite her unit block.<br/>

We had a coffee with her and then walked home.

                Morning at Alex's having coffee with Nathan, before we picked up AJ and went to dads. We picked up Red Rooster for dinner - and I call and joked with Jas that her new i30 (that I drove) was making noises.

                <p>Took AJ to do the shopping - paid cash for a change, with the leftover cash from selling the Galaxy S8 phones the other week.<br/><br/>Then went out to bunnings to get plastic containers for packing, only to realise they were wrong.

I climbed up the outcome and into the wooden playground with him - it was tight getting back down inside.<br/><br/>Took beer to Dave's in the evening - most bottle shops were closed, so I had to park next to Toyota at Kedron and walk down to BWS on Gympie Rd.</p>
