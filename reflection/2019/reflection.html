<li>Another early start - more Cheerios with AJ for breakfast</li>
<li>This time we ate at his small table and chairs</li>
<li>He's getting better with the spoon</li>
<li>AJ said 'fan' for the first time this morning - couldn't make him say anything else</li>
<li>Walked to work as it was scheduled for rain</li>
<li>Normal day at work - felt like I was back on top of things</li>
<li>Left early (for a change), came home and prepared dinner</li>
<li>Talked to mum about car options for the convertible she wants</li>
<li>Had to have a quick work call, AJ wanted to sit on me so we did that for a while</li>
<li>Eventually Julie tried to shower him and he cried wanting me</li>
<li>Got off the call, finished cooking a Chicken stir fry</li>
<li>Julie and I ate together - we watch Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi' episode</li>
<li>I then put on the second part of 'Turbos and Temples 2' on youtube</li>
<li>I went for a run - only the short 6km loop, had to pee on the run home near the kindy</li>

<li>Lazy morning, slept in and got ready quite late</li>
<li>Took AJ to day care with Julie</li>
<li>Pretty quiet day at work - focused on helping with last minute La Redoute presentation the FR team had planned without any real notice</li>

<ul>
<li>Eggs for breakfast this morning, our usual weekend tradition (although - we had to ration our dwindling supply of toast)</li>
<li>After, we left to drive to Toowoomba</li>
<li>At Toowoomba we went to an organic cafe and Julie got a coffee, and AJ a smooth - it was expensive, but nice. I left them a google review.</li>
<li>We then drove over to pickup the sim racing seat and wheel - Fanatec GT3 RS</li>
<li>The seat was too big to fit into the car - we had to split it in half to get it in</li>
<li>After, we took AJ to Queens park where we played. </li>
<li>He loved the merry-go-round. It was his first time on one.</li>
<li>After the park we went hunting for a bakery - the first one was closed, but the second open</li>
<li>Julie and I had pies for lunch, AJ didn't really eat his sausage roll - but we all shared a jam doughnut </li>
<li>We jumped back into the car and drove back to Brisbane, calling mum to meet her at our place</li>
<li>Mum and Tim came over - Tim stayed, while Mum and I left to look at cars for her (Convertible 2 series BMW's)</li>
<li>First we looked at a black on at a Jaguar dealer at Newstead - it was fine, but I hated the black color and it had been kept OK</li>
<li>We then drove to a spa (On Eagles Wings) at the Gold Coast hinterland to see the other car, which was much nicer.</li>
<li>Mum and I  had a tea/coffee together to discuss - then negotiated and agreed to a price to buy the car</li>
<li>We drove back to Brisbane, where I searched and found the car written off - so we called and cancelled the sale.</li>
<li>Mum looked after AJ, and Julie and I went out</li>
<li>We had Burgers and Ribs at James St, then went for a walk and had Magnum ice creams</li>
<li>Finally, we came home - said goodbye to Mum &amp; Tim, then crashed out to sleep</li>

<ul>
<li>Regular breakfast today - no eggs this weekend as we were all out of bread</li>
<li>We got ready, and started our drive up to the Noosa Habitat camp grounds</li>
<li>I tried to read my book on Agile PM on the way up (on the tablet), but AJ was quite unsettled and kept needing my attention</li>
<li>I fed AJ throughout the drive - mostly little potato style balls we took from our plane trip back to Brisbane earlier in the week</li>
<li>We stopped at Yandina IGA for supplies - we got a box of Split ice cream, and I bought AJ a hot wheels car (R34 GTR)</li>
<li>We kept driving and made it to habitat - which needed us to drive down a long dirt road to get there</li>
<li>Arriving, we sat near the water with Andy, Laticha, John, Sally, Therese, and Justine - enjoying our ice creams shortly after arriving.</li>
<li>We moved our gear to be under a better patch of shade, then had more of Tich's birthday cake</li>
<li>AJ got changed into his swim wear, then we took him into the water which was incredibly shallow - and allowed him to walk out far</li>
<li>He loved independently playing in the water, although Julie kept on getting worried</li>
<li>We walked out some distance - then walked back to sit around the shoreline under the shade of trees, while AJ played in the shallows with rocks</li>
<li>He put a few in his mouth - not sure if he ate one or not</li>
<li>After a while we picked him up to leave - and he was covered in liquid poo</li>
<li>I managed to clean him and I up, although my singlet got poo juice on it and we washed it - trying later to dry it out the window of our car</li>
<li>We drove to Dad and Tiziana's house - getting KFC on the way for a very late lunch</li>
<li>There, AJ got his Christmas presents from them - and we found presents from Danyal &amp; Louise</li>
<li>We stayed for some time - with AJ saying "Nonna" for the first time</li>
<li>Arriving at home, we got AJ ready for bed - and I left for a run</li>
<li>The run was 13.5km, first long run of the year towards my marathon target</li>
<li>I got home, had a shower, and we watched two episodes of Seinfeld in bed before going to sleep</li>

<li>Woke up to a cute AJ laying on me giving me hugs</li>
<li>We got up and had breakfast - Cheerios for him, porridge for me</li>
<li>Walk to work today - started listening to Freakonomics about the best exercise from 2014</li>
<li>Lots of talking this morning - had my first 1:1 with Kelvin since his return to work from Holidays, and a good chat with Mark for the same</li>
<li>Stayed late to try and punch out the Carrier Improvement work</li>
<li>Decided to skip gym and walk home - still dealing with doms from Friday</li>
<li>Called Dad and talked to him on the way home about the sim racing setup. He's worried it will take up too much space.</li>
<li>Kept talking until I got home - eventually talking about Tiz's family property in Italy</li>
<li>Walked in to a candlelit dinner with Julie (sausages, salad, and fritters)</li>
<li>Called Jas - made sure she was ok after mum told me she was followed and had issues. Jas confirmed it was mum exaggerating.</li>
<li>Browsed on the computer for places to stay at the GC marathon - not much left</li>
<li>Paid David (very late) for our trip to the Cotswalds together</li>
<li>Organised a birthday lunch for mum on Sunday to the pineapple hotel - Jas will book</li>
<li>Ordered us a gluten free cake from the Cheesecake shop for the weekend</li>
<li>Entered myself into the GC marathon</li>
<li>Organised a catch-up with Thomas morning to talk about work opportunities</li>

Work up to the family still asleep. Early morning trip to work, dropped my things off, then ran to the Powerhouse and back. Super sweaty and unconfortable.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Let a lady in to fit the filters at work today - was kind of odd to see a female handyman.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Left work in the afternoon to pickup my car and take it to Tyrone @ Nitrone. It wasn't making any noise so I left it there.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Finished work late and went to the gym that was packed - new year rush I guess.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
After gym I went to Aldi and bought salami sticks to eat, then walked to Ultratune. Car eventually made the noise, isolated to the idler pulley. Getting a quote to fix it.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Went home, bought tickets to ProgFest 2019 - will go with Dave Boyle.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Played Dark Souls Remastered on the switch, finally got down the two bosses (Orleigh and Slough?)</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Settled into bed to sleep </div>

Stayed home longer than usual to play with AJ - we watched a video on YouTube carwow on the Audi RS4.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Walked to work, arrived late for first meeting with Magento for the year.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Had my PRISM test results presented today, nothing surprising about them - but interesting none the less.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Walked home listening to Feakanomics on "The Dangers of Safety". Finished that, then had to stop and sit on steps at a sporting club building near he hospital to make a work call to Mark in Vietnam.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Walked the long way home on the sports ground side, walked past a pack of dog owners near Ballymore.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Walked in, surprised AJ who took me into his room to read a book on the alphabet. Julie then put him to bed, as I wrapped up a work email.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
I called dad and talked about the sim rig - we'll try it out in two weeks, and consider screen vs VR headset. </div>
<div dir="ltr">
The boy wouldn't sleep, and Julie was going to Newstead for an early farewell for Therese (Tish wouldn't be able to make the Australia day farewell) - so I let him stay up while I ate leftovers.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Soon we put him to bed, then I booked my accommodation for Dave's wedding in the UK on airbnb at Blagdon.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Called mum and checked on her, confirming her birthday lunch plans and her thoughts on a new car.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Went to bed and read more of Managing Projects with Agile - before Julie came home and we slept. </div>

Lazy morning, ended up making AJ breakfast and slowly getting ready to head in with Julie.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Dropped AJ off at day care, he cried so Julie took him outside to a carer.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Work was uneventful - long management stand up, but otherwise pretty normal.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Finished up work and decided to try a long run after work. Ran from gasworks around to the Story Bridge and back again (about 12km). It was very warm, so I really struggled to maintain pace.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Stopped briefly at the wharf under the bridge, first time I've been there since the refurbishment. Definitely looks nice, but already had a fairly contrived bunch of people showing off.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
Upon getting back to work I walked home, before ravishing a mixed dinner of curry rice, frittas, and a sausage.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
I watched Norsemen for the first time - it was pretty funny, and certainly well done.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
I settled into bed to read but Julie came in, so we watched Seinfeld (Marble Rye and the baby named 'Seven' episodes) </div>

                Usual start to the morning - opted for shorts and t-shirt for work as it was so hot. Dropped AJ off at day care, but he cried badly - poor boy.<br/>
<br/>
Had a relaxed day, David was sick - and my day was focused on our carrier initiative and revisiting the cross-functional strategy (putting the Magento dev's into the teams).<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Played pool with Marlsey and chatted, then finished the day with meetings before skipping the team pub session (no fun when you're not drinking), and went to the gym.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
First dead lift session for the year, did a relaxed 120kg 5x5 (although had to hook grip it... which was annoying), and mixed in overheads/clean-and-jerk and some kettlebells. My wrist straps kept falling apart, so I stopped early with the clean-and-jerk's and threw my straps away on the way out.<br/>
<br/>
Walked home, listened to Freakonomics on Yang's run for the 2020 US President and his opinions and observations on the US economy.</div>
<div>
<br/>
Got home - convinced Julie of take-out so went down to the urban village and tried the Chinese place there. They seemed to forget one of the dishes, but quickly cooked it and I got out of there in 30mins or so. It was a good Char Kway Teow (i've been looking for one), so I was pretty stoked I found one so good, so close to home.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Watched Seinfeld as we ate (Cadillac episode, followed by the Marissa Tomey episode) - before heading to beg to play Dark Souls. Made it mostly through The Dukes Archive to the bonfire, and called it a night.</div>

                Had our morning hot breakfast - AJ wanted to sit on an adult chair with us.<br/>
<br/>
Left for open for inspections - saw a Gaythorne house that was OK and opposite the road from the barracks. Then onto Alderly for a house on the hill that was ok, expensive, and overlooked Stafford shops.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the enchanted forest with Julie's mums group - first time I've been there. I talked mostly to Will and a bit to Evan, while chasing the boy around.<br/>
<br/>
We left to another open home at Mitchelton - it was 3 bedrooms upstairs, and 2 disconnected downstairs. It had a big empty block next door.<br/>
<br/>
After getting home I loaded the old cable cabinet into our car to take to the tip, then called mum to talk about the house and her birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I drove back to Kelvin Grove to the barber in the urban village near the butcher. I think the guys were Turkish, but either way - the hair cut was really good.<br/>
<br/>
Later we went to a park next to Brookside with Adam and Dalia - Adam and I went and got boost juice for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
We left the park and went straight to Jas and Laughy's unit, and swam. AJ was ridiculously excited to swim, and extremely upset when we took him away from the pool.<br/>
<br/>
I grabbed fish and chips for us all from Caraway Pier at the urban village, and after what was a very messy meal we went home and I put AJ to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Julie had an early night, and I stayed up on the PC.

                First run with the office guys - Jack and Matt. Did a few laps around the office, and then settled in to shower and start the very busy day of back to back meetings.<br/>
<br/>
Met Chase, Amy, and Jimmy from Team USA for the first time to talk improvements there.

                <p dir="ltr">No breakfast for AJ beyond a little fruit, as he and Julie were meeting friends for breakfast.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had my breakfast and walked to work listening to Freakonomics on the even ticketing industry. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Was a really busy morning at work, before Julie picked me up at lunch and we drove to Ray White Real Estate at Newmarket to make an offer on a house at Gaythrone ($522.5k).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I arrived back at work, and pushed on into the evening with late meetings - and the first chat with Fred for the new year. He debriefed us on the La Redoute workshops I managed to get out of having to fly to France to attend. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I walked home, and talked to Julie a little. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I tried calling Jon, but no luck - so I called and talked to Andy who told me about preparing to sell and move, and about his back issue. He had to go early, so I finished up and tried Jon again. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I talked to Jon about Australia Day plans, and he told me about he and Lauren looking at houses. </p>
<p dir="ltr">When I got home I quickly ate noodles Julie's mum had made, and went for a short run. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I tried calling Geremy and had no luck, then messaged Jess to try and organize a time they I can farewe her properly after she ninja'd out of the company while I was away. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I had a shower, and went to bed - but AJ was unsettled so I went to the couch to write about the day. </p>

                Drove the car to the gym, and then to the shops for pizza ingredients for this afternoon.<br/>
Stopped by Supercheap Auto for new oil and filter at their Australia Day sale.<br/>
<br/>
Made AJ his first banana, peanut butter, and honey sandwich - he kind of liked it.<br/>
<br/>
The real estate agent called about the Gaythorne house - still no counter offer.<br/>
<br/>
Went to Holly and Kim's place in the afternoon, went for a swim, then cooked pizzas in the BBQ before coming home to relax and wind down.

                <p dir="ltr">Prepared food this morning - sticky chicken wings while Julie dropped Therese to the airport to leave to live in Denver.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drove down the coast to Jon and Lauren's place, and say Dylan and Christina there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ate a lot of food - tried Dutch pancake for the first time.<br/></p>
<p dir="ltr">Then had a swim, before settling back to the house - and playing on Jon's new electric scooter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Went for a late run - got out my second half marathon this year, and first time under 2h in training (did 1:51 during the Noosa half, which remains my PB)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rested and ate dinner watching the first half of The Grand Tour's Columbia adventure. </p>

                Breakfast with Brett and Lisa, who I hadn't seen since their wedding near Samford early on in my relationship with Julie.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan came around - we had coffee, talked, and then I got him hooked on sim racing.<br/>
<br/>
Went for my long run for marathon training in the evening (28km) - fireworks went off as I climbed the story bridge, then I found that Master Chef was filming at the brewery under the bridge.

We played, AJ went to bed, then Dennis and I talked - played the racing sim, then sat on the balcony and talked some more.

                Left work early to have Julie pick me up. We drove to Heritage at Sprintwood to get a bank cheque for my new car - the red Toyota 86. We then went to the dealership at Underwood to pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
Rushed home in it, quickly put the plates on, then went to Queensland Transport at Toowong - just getting inside in time.<br/><br/>Went home and washed the car, before going out for a drive up Mt Nebo with Alex.

                Run club - first time David Middleton came out with us, and he absolutely killed it for someone who hadn't run in a decade.<br/>

Went back for meetings - then gym after work for leg day, and a walk home.

                Left home early - was nice to hear a big "Daddy!" from AJ the moment I knocked on the door.<br/>
We played a little before he went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
We watched the second episode of season 6 of Brooklyn Nine Nine - where it shoes Scully and Hitchcock as young, successful cops.<br/><br/>Read a little in bed next to Julie, before spending time on the computer checking out our finances and looking at property. We found a house at Newmarket we want to look at - but agreed to make an offer on the town house behind us if that doesn't strike us as amazing.

Julie went out with work friends for her annual awards.<br/>

                Went to see some houses today - one place at Mitchelton had the owner, Walter, and old gentleman show us around. It was already under contract, but neat.<br/>

I grabbed some lunch, and we ate antipasto as we watched the F1 build up for the Australian Qualifying.<br/>
<br/>Julie went out to a concern tonight with Sal &amp; John - who came in to say hello for the first time in ages.

Checked in in Blagdon, then Uber'd into Bristol for Dave's bucks night. Ended the night with a cocktail with berocca, vodka, lime, soda, and tobasco.

                Dave and Hannah's wedding today - got my pants on at the Boyd family Farmhouse, then the rest in the room at the venue.<br/>
<br/>
Was a nice wedding - but upset Hannah at the end of the night by mentioning Dave's ex in an anecdote about pranks. Felt horrible about it, apologized to her and cried - had Dave's family console me and tell me it was OK.

Took the car back - called Dave and Hannah to straighten out last night.<br/><br/>Looked after Evan and Enzo while Al and Nina had a night out. We created a fort under the dining table, and laid there watching Peppa Pig on YouTube.

                Last day with Andy, Megan, and Troy from Magento in the office - the team left for Netherworld after work, but I stayed behind and trialled my first 6km run since physio - to the powerhouse and back.<br/><br/>Walked home after - watched game 5 of the NBA finals, where Golden State just managed to win and stay in it - but Kevin Durant was injured.

We ate, played some HTC Vive, and then ate ice cream and chatted.

                Run today - first 13k run since going to the physio. Managed it without pain, but still not good enough to do the marathon.<br/>

Then went to Ba Ngoi's cleaned the backyard, washing all the concrete, the shed, pavers, and moved all the extra furniture out. Dropped of a suitcase of Nina's speech pathologist stuff off to Jas on the way home.<br/>

Had a shower, and the hot water valve broke. Drop back to Ba Ngoi's to get the tools, then fixed it.

GT3 race in the evening with the SimXP guys at Vallelunga - did ok, but just couldn't help but eventually cook the rears and spin the GT86. Was super frustrating finishing 23/23 in the first race, and 21/23 in the second.

                Yearly skin check this morning - first time to the new clinic for Dr Fawcett out near the hospital at Annerly. All came up OK.<br/>
<br/>
Drove and parked in Tenneriffe, horrible reverse park up-hill that the clutch didn't like. After work I ran back to the car, drove to the office, then parked and went to the gym.<br/>
<br/>On the way back to the car from the gym - saw a drunk guy park his car in the bank carpark, and follow me into the building. I should have checked he wasn't going to drive it home.

                My birthday - woken to a presence of a 1kg jar of minced garlic from Julie as a joke.<br/><br/>Rough day in the office - had a D&amp;M with David about what's going on after finding the HR system has been updated so my staff aren't pointing to me without any real comms.<br/><br/>Pissed off - so went to the gym and did my first 2x 100kg bench - followed up with a nice 90kg clean and jerk.<br/>
<br/>
Home, and Julie cooked a Vietnamese meal for me - and we ate while we listened to the Vietnamese Aladdin soundtrack.

                Home at a reasonable time - raced Donington GP in the GT3 class, managed quali in 12th, which was awesome considering the field of 20. Did well in the race for a while, until I spun 10 laps in - then it just fell away as I over-drove, messed up my pit stop, then spun just at the end to lose 2 spots to finish last in 20th.<br/>

                Looked after AJ while Julie went to see the Lion King movie with Christina - we moved his teepee into the lounge room and sat under it.<br/>
<br/>
Later, we went to Ba Ngoi's house and told her that Julie's pregnant with #2.

                Breakfast with Dad, Tiz, and Tim at Chermside (Cafe 63) to tell them about baby #2 - was OK, coffee was bad so Tiz and I walked up to Archer to get another coffee after.<br/>

Maxim's birthday party after lunch - first time at the YMCA at Bowen Hills, AJ loved jumping into the foam pit.

                Home from work early feeling crappy with a sore neck - Julie came and picked me up, and I arrived home to Ba Ngoi and AJ. They had a roast pork bahn mi waiting for me for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
I laid in bed with AJ watching TV most of the evening until my neck felt better.

                Went to the gym - saw a police office driving a blue Focus RS as I crossed the road. Talked to Jared about starting at GO1 this week while walking home from the gym.<br/>
<br/>
Practised some tracks/cars on Assetto Corsa in the evening.

                Home early - then went out for a run down to Downey Park and back. Stopped on a bench at the start of the path near home, and talked to Sebastian from Net Research to let them know we'll stop using them regularly.<br/>
<br/>
F1 race tonight - best result yet of 6th. Vito got the shits with me for hitting him once (it was close between us - not deliverable), then a second time we nearly hit when we both took weird lines through turn one. I told him to chill.

                Walking home and noticed Tom in the driveway, awkwardly balanced talking to him while I talked to Julie on the phone.<br/>

Then watched the Hungaring GP - Verstappen lead most of the race, then Hamilton got him just at the end. Was interesting to watch them race on the track that I'd only just raced on myself the week prior with the SimXP guys.

                Julie had an obstetrician appointment at 4pm, and we'd talked about me going to get AJ if she was running late. I didn't hear from her, so walked in the rain to AJ's day care - getting a hold of Julie just before I got there to tell me it's been moved.<br/>
<br/>
I sat at the bottom of his daycare and looked at the Ekka setting up - then called Paul the recruiter back to discuss things.

Evening was the GT3 race at Suzuka where I went in feeling good about my chances after good practice, but I was well off the pace - and made lots of silly mistakes in the car.

                First run after being sick - ran a 4:30m/km 5km loop to prepare for Bridge to Brisbane this week.<br/><br/>Did some practice laps on Phillip Island for the GT3 race tomorrow, and got a call from Dave Boyle and talked to him while I practiced. Mid-practice, AJ came out with his fox teddy - and I took him to bed with Julie.

Finished 19/22 - but was overall happy, as I didn't make any particularly horrible mistakes, and did a few good battles throughout.<br/><br/>AJ woke up really upset - wouldn't come to me, forced Julie to finish her work.

                Coffee at Alex's in the morning - before he dropped us off at the airport and we flew to Cairns. There was a large group waiting for the hire car transfer bus, so we had to wait for the second bus.<br/><br/>Got lunch at the main shopping centre - eating it in the car as AJ slept.<br/>
<br/>Walked the esplanade in the afternoon, AJ enjoying walking along the logs that line the edge of the path before the large drop down to the water.

                Tish and Andy's wedding at Port Douglas - had to laugh as Alicia ran down the isle loudly exclaiming "AJ!" while pulling her dress up.  Afterwards we watched her run to the nearby park as Andy tried to chase her down.<br/>
<br/>
Evening reception at The Oaks, where we sat on a deck surrounded by a pond full of fish. I spent most of the night talking to John and Holly who were closest to me, and a guy Peter who's wife is good friends with Tish - and works in IT at Datacom and knew my name from Icon. Couldn't recall when/how we came across each other, however.

                Post Tish and Andy's wedding morning - woke up not feeling great after drinking the night before. Went back to sleep after settling AJ and Julie.<br/>
<br/>
For the morning - we went to Little Larder for a coffee, then came home for AJ to nap. Afterwards we swam in the pool, then went to the surf club for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
I took AJ on the playground at the surf club, he fell while trying to walk across a rope bridge and I caught him dangling via one arm. He was really upset and saying "owwww" so I thought we may have done some real damage to his arm, but it was just bruised and sore.<br/>
<br/>
Later that night we all came over to our house to relax outside, while a 2000's music video playlist ran on the TV inside, and we ate ice cream and watched a slideshow of Justine's dive pictures.

                Checked out and went to the Port Douglas markets, then went for breakfast. Justine bumped into two American friends she met on her dive, who joined us for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>After we drove back to Cairns, relaxed - then went out to the Cascade Falls for a walk up the long path beside the ravine. Forgot to bring AJs pram, which was a mistake - it was a long walk up/back.<br/>
<br/>
We took AJ to the Fit Tree Playground build into the tree with a big spiral slide. On the way we saw cars from the Targa Great Barrier Reef race.

<br/>
Home - where I sat in bed working on my Lean Startup book report. Stopped to watch the Mortal Kombat TV show, at which time AJ walked in to see me - so I turned it off and we went to bed together.

<br/>
Talked for two hours, had to jog home and quickly scoff dinner late while Julie worked.

                Left work early - talked to Alison as we walked up the hill together, her talking about a play date that she was uneasy about on the weekend.<br/>
<br/>Picked up AJ early, and drove into the city - he spent the entire time saying "City" and "Tower", before parking near GOMA.<br/>
<br/>
We ate Nandos quickly, then went down to see the water display for the opening night of Brisbane Festival.

                Finally was able to call Jas to congratulate her on her engagement. <br/>
<br/>
Julie, AJ and I then walked to the markets - where an old man on a mobility chair stopped to ask if AJ wanted to pat his dog riding on it. The dog barked at a passer by, so AJ nor I were keen to pat it.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening I removed the old sealant from the shower, then put in new sealant. The first attempt was a mess and didn't stick at all.

                Home from Toowoomba, and played lego with AJ - and we made a pair of race cars with front and rear wings (F1 style) and raced around the ottoman in the middle of the room.<br/>
<br/>
Forced AJ to sleept without Julie - had to go in/out multiple times as he wailed on and off for a long time. He started to settle, asking me to wipe his nose each time I went in towards the end - then finally asking me to stay and lay down with him.

                First interview with a tech start-up, quickly turned into three interview - first with the COO, then with the innovation evangelist, and then a few hours later with the CEO. Surprised when the CEO told me the salary - it was significantly below market.<br/><br/>I ran the CEO through scrum, and the specific application we had in our organization.

Went for a drive up Mt Cootha - had a pair of kids on BMX bikes hear me coming along the top, and gave me the signal to rev the car - albiet, they did it like a motorcycle by holding their hands out like holding handlebars and rotating their hand to rev the bike.<br/>

                Met with Don at work - got his feedback on our target approach, portfolio view, and agreed to try a first customer project through the mechanism.<br/><br/>We sat in the Fish Bowl room at the front of the office - and shared stories on martial arts.
