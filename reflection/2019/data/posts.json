Then onto Alderly for a house on the hill that was ok, expensive, and overlooked Stafford shops.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the enchanted forest with Julie's mums group - first time I've been there. I talked mostly to Will and a bit to Evan, while chasing the boy around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left to another open home at Mitchelton - it was 3 bedrooms upstairs, and 2 disconnected downstairs. It had a big empty block next door.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter getting home I loaded the old cable cabinet into our car to take to the tip, then called mum to talk about the house and her birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI drove back to Kelvin Grove to the barber in the urban village near the butcher. I think the guys were Turkish, but either way - the hair cut was really good.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater we went to a park next to Brookside with Adam and Dalia - Adam and I went and got boost juice for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left the park and went straight to Jas and Laughy's unit, and swam. AJ was ridiculously excited to swim, and extremely upset when we took him away from the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grabbed fish and chips for us all from Caraway Pier at the urban village, and after what was a very messy meal we went home and I put AJ to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie had an early night, and I stayed up on the PC.",
