      "content": "Late wake up, then we quickly got ready to go and have breakfast with Jared, Kylie, and baby Cooper. It was the first time I met Kylie and Cooper, and the first time Julie and AJ have met any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe met at the Smug Fig, and I had this potato gem/avacado/egg breakfast dish that was heavy and delicious - as I jugged AJ who didn't want to stay in his seat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe found another car, and we played cars and chatted - before walking through the antique store and nursery nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left and stopped quickly at Paw Paw for Julie to get some flowers for mums birthday later - but they didn't have any so we drove home.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie put AJ down to sleep, and I went to start the car to check it was running OK since we cleaned the belts. All was working well, so I drove it over to Virginia to fill up on ethanol for the first real drive since coming back.<br/><br/>Typically - it was hot and there was traffic out, so I drove it at my usual pedestrian pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nCame straight home, and quickly got ready to go for mum's birthday lunch, only to get a call from Tim telling us we're late. Apparently Jas had booked for 12:30pm, but we were only getting ready to leave at 12:40pm.<br/><br/>We drove down to BP, and Julie jumped out to get some flowers. Upon return, she asked about the cake - at which time I realised I had forgot to pick it up.<br/>\n<br/>We rushed over to Ashgrove Cheesecake Shop, and picked it up (gluten free of course) - before rushing over to the Pineapple Hotel for lunch.<br/>\n<br/>We met Boyd for the first time - and all of us kids and Laughy were there. We had lunch, gave mum her presents, and played with AJ on the playground (although he refused to go inside it)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter getting home, I got ready for my run - covering myself in sun cream and grabbing a had - leaving with the sun still high in the sky at 5:30pm. I even ran with a hat for the first time, which wasn't actually all too bad. I made it over 18km, and felt good.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon getting home I had a quick shower, then played Overwatch with Jared and Dylan. We didn't play long, then I jumped off to finish the YearCompass planning with Julie.<br/>\n<br/>We finished the plan - then settled into bed for an early wind down.",

      "content": "Had a bit of a sleep in today, feeling pretty tired after the long run yesterday<br/>\nAJ had a toasted sandwich while I had porridge (although he snuck some of my breakfast!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI rode to work, it was very tough as my legs were so damn tired<br/>\n<br/>\nGot a call from the agent on the Gaythorne house we liked, told him we'd like to make an offer and booked a time to meet tomorrow to formalise it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso had my support roles arrive for my GT pro sim racing seat - but left that at work so I didn't have to lug them home on-foot.<br/>\n<br/>Spent too long at work focusing on this data for Martyn, but really wanted to get it polished before the end of the week when he needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to the gym, it was packed and I couldn't do much - tried arm work, which worked out OK considering i'm still nursing a really sore wrist after the gym last week.<br/><br/>Talked to Julie for half of the walk home about how we go about making an offer on the house. Afterwards, I tried to call both Jon, then Andy on the way home for a chat - couldn't get either so just put on the end of the Freakonomics episode with Trevor Noah.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome and had leftovers of garlic vegetables for the KG Chinese shop, along with an omelette - then ate it with Julie while we watched Seinfeld's episode on the shower head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad a shower - then sat down to pay the bill for the guy who fixed our Air Conditioner today (Callum @ Speedy Air Con), moved some money around because Julie got paid - then settled in to write my daily memories.",
